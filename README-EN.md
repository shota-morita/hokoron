# Hokoron: The Theory of Structural Retention

**"To redesign—without destroying. A philosophy that encompasses contradiction and preserves structure."**

---

## Purpose

Hokoron seeks to build a structure that enables us to **coexist in a world where differences, contradictions, and conflicts are unavoidable**.

At its core lies the idea of “redesigning without destruction.”  
Whether internal contradictions within the individual or complex societal conflicts, the aim is not elimination or unification,  
but rather to **encompass and retain them within a structure that allows both transformation and coexistence**.

This is not limited to ethics or philosophy—it is a **structural philosophy for modern individuals**,  
applicable to education, politics, technology, communities, and everyday life.

## Core Principles

Hokoron is founded on the following four pillars:

1. **Encompassing Contradiction**  
   Contradictions are not rejected or resolved but retained as part of the structure.  
2. **Retention and Transformation of Structure**  
   Structures are preserved and adapted to withstand change without collapse.  
3. **Reconstruction of Meaning**  
   In an age of value relativism, we generate meaning anew.  
4. **Coexistence with One’s Own Contradictions**  
   Acknowledging the contradictions inherent in human existence, and grounding one’s actions in them.
